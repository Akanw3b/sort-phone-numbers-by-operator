sort phone numbers by operator


First, you need to define the list of phone numbers you want to sort. Here's an example list:
Phone_numbers script

Next, you need to define the dictionary of operators and their corresponding codes. Here's an example dictionary:

operators file

Finally, you can use a for loop to iterate over each phone number in the list and check its operator by comparing its first three digits with the operator codes in the dictionary. Here's an example script:

python script main.py 

This script will print each phone number followed by its operator. For example:

makefile file
